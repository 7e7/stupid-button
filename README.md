stupid-button
=============

Adds an important button to JIRA tickets: an instant feedback mechanism for developers to mark a ticket as stupid, to a degree of their satisfaction, without it being recorded to the project.  The stupid button is added to the actions toolbar of all tickets in specified JIRA projects.

You can add this as an unpacked extension in chrome.

Make sure to change the manifest.json to reflect your jira tickets, e.g. "http://jira.myapp.it/FOOBAR-*"
